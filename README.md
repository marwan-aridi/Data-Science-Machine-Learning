# Data Science and Machine Learning Project

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of data science and machine learning methodologies implemented on a dataset. The goal of the project is to demonstrate the application of data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms to extract valuable insights and make predictions. The project leverages various Python libraries for statistical analysis, data manipulation, and model building.

## Project Objectives

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values by imputing them or removing incomplete records.
   - Standardize and normalize numerical features for consistency in analysis.
   - Encode categorical variables using techniques such as one-hot encoding.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualize the dataset to identify trends, patterns, and potential outliers.
   - Analyze distributions of key variables and their relationships through plots like scatterplots, histograms, and correlation matrices.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Create new features from existing data to enhance model performance.
   - Select the most important features using techniques like correlation analysis and feature importance rankings.

4. **Machine Learning Model Development:**
   - Implement and evaluate multiple machine learning algorithms, including:
     - Linear Regression
     - Decision Trees
     - Random Forests
     - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
     - Neural Networks
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

5. **Model Evaluation and Validation:**
   - Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and mean squared error (MSE).
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to validate the models' performance on unseen data.

6. **Visualization and Reporting:**
   - Present results through detailed visualizations, including feature importance plots, ROC curves, and confusion matrices.
   - Summarize findings and provide actionable recommendations based on the analysis.
